	<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is from Epicurious dot com. I'm using this for the sake of practicing making recipe pages.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup drained capers, patted dry</li>
        <li>1 small or 1/2 large head of cauliflower (about 1 pound), cut into small florets</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, patted dry</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces casarecce, gemelli, or other medium pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 cups baby arugula</li>
    </ul>
	<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li><p>Heat 4 Tbsp. oil in a large deep-sided skillet over medium-high. Add capers and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until they burst and are crisp, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer capers to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Reserve oil in skillet.</p></li>
       <li><p>Cook cauliflower in same skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add garlic, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Cover and cook until cauliflower begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Uncover and increase heat to high. Add chickpeas, 2 Tbsp. butter, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower and chickpeas are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
       <li><p>Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.</p></li> 
       <li><p>Remove skillet from heat and add lemon juice, 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid, and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter. Add pasta, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until coated.</p></li>
       <li><p>Divide arugula and pasta among bowls, stirring to combine. Top with reserved crispy capers.</p></li>
    </ol>

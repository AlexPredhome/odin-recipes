	<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is from the New York Times cooking app. I'm using this for the sake of practicing making recipe pages. For a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sautéed brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving</li>
    </ul>
	<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li><p>Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)</p></li>
       <li><p>In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut-side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.</p></li>
       <li><p>In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.</p></li>
